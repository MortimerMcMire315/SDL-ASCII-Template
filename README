This is a template for making programs using the ASCII character set. 
You'll need SDL, as characters are blitted from a spritesheet as opposed 
to setting up a console. 

Three functions are included for printing individual characters, strings,
 and integers.

A few basic colors are defined as examples. At the moment, there is no 
support for background color. If you want to add background colors, 
just make alternate versions of the bitmap with different background 
colors and blit from those instead.
